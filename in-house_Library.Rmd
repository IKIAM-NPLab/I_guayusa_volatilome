# Introduction

The document aims to record the spectral library assembly of authentic compounds analyzed in the Gas Chromatography Coupled to Electron Ionization (quadrupole) Mass Spectrometry (GC-EI (q)MS). A brief explanation and graphics are included for each step.

# Standards preparation

All standards were accurately weighed (**Table 1**) and diluted in mass spectrometry-grade methanol. Working solutions of authentic compounds were prepared by diluting the stock solutions (**Table 1**) with methanol to the final concentrations of 1 µg/mL, five µg/mL, and eight µg/mL.

**Table 1.** Authentic compounds description and weight.

# Compound deconvolution

The raw MS data (.qgd) (available in [link](Data/in-house_Library/qgd_raw_Files)) were converted to (.abf) (available in [link](Data/in-house_Library/abf_raw_Files)) format using Reifycs file converter. MS-DIAL 4.9.221218 was used to deconvolute the raw spectral data using a pipeline that included peak detection, alignment, filtering, and gap filling. Parameters used in MS-DIAL are available in (.txt) file ([link](Data/in-house_Library/MS-DIAL_Parameter/MSDIAL_Parameter.txt)) and (.med2) file ([link](Data/in-house_Library/MS-DIAL_Parameter)) (direct load in MS-DIAL). Deconvoluted compound retention time (RT) and retention index (RI) are shown in **Table 2**.

**Table 2.** RT and RI of the authentic compounds analyzed in GC-MS.

>RT, retention time in minutes, RI, Semi-standard non-polar Van den Dool and Kratz linear retention index, STD, standard deviation (n ≥ 3).

The RI of n-Alkanes was calculated using an R Script (available in [link](RI_Calculation_Script.R)), with each chromatogram (6 analytical runs) as a reference for the rest. The RI of the other compounds was automatically calculated by MS-DIAL (using the RT of n-Alkanes, available in (.txt) format to direct load in MS-DIAL, [link](Data/in-house_Library/abf_raw_Files/Batch_05112024) of batch 05/11/2024,  and [link](Data/in-house_Library/abf_raw_Files/Batch_20112024) of batch 20/11/2024) and reported as the average of three runs (one run for each concentration: 1 ppm, five ppm, and eight ppm).

# Library assembly

All deconvoluted compounds (**Table 2**) were exported to MS-FINDER ver. 3.60, as seen in **Figure 1**.

**Figure 1.** Deconvoluted compound exportation from MS-DIAL to MS-FINDER. 

MS-FINDER helps us quickly add metadata to each compound exported from MS-DIAL, as seen in **Figure 2**. After adding metadata of all compounds, we can export in (.msp) format to the posterior edition (**Figure 2**).

**Figure 2.** Use of MS-FINDER to add metadata to the compounds deconvoluted in MS-DIAL.

## Library to MS-DIAL

Finally, using the text editor, the exported (.msp) was edited according to MS-DIAL key names of the compounds metadata, as seen in **Figure 3**. After that, the (.msp) library is ready to use in MS-DIAL for compound identification.

The final library can be downloaded at the following link: [IKIAM_NPL_GCMS_Lib_2MSDIAL.msp](Result/in-house_Library_Result/IKIAM_NPL_GCMS_Lib_2MSDIAL.msp)

## Library to NIST MS Search

The last edited library (.msp) was loaded in the NIST MS Search 2.4 software, as seen in **Figure 4**.

In the "Librarian" window of NIST MS Search software, compound by compound was added to a user NIST library, as seen in **Figure 5**.

After all compounds were added to the user NIST library, the created library is available in the NIST "library Search Options" window (**Figure 6**). The library is ready to use for metabolite identification in the NIST MS Search software.
